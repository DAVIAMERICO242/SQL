# SQL querying
In this topic I'm remembering me SQL Server usage one more time, I'm also showing it as what I name as SQL basics to intermediate. I'm going to explore from how its exportation works to subqueries. This topic regards SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ANY, some stats measures, such as MAX, MIN,..., and mightly some more stuff like that.
