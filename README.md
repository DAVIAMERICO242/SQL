# SQL querying
In this topic I'm remembering me SQL Server usage one more time (though using .ipynb), I'm also showing it as what I name as SQL basics to intermediate. I'm going to explore from how its exportation works to correlated subqueries and the JOINs. This topic regards SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ANY, some stats measures, such as MAX, MIN,..., and mightly some more stuff like that. 

Note: I tried to explain a quite clear what the SQL is doing when I state some clause or query, I think the most of things I exlained are correct.
